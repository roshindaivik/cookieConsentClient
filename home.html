          When power conference athletic directors are in the process of hiring
          a new football coach, they're essentially faced with two decisions:
          either take a swing at upside and identify an up-and-coming assistant
          or head coach at a lower level, or pay big money to lure a sitting
          coach with a comfortable job at one of the nation's premier leagues.
          Available resources play a huge a factor in the final call, but we've
          seen some schools pull off major coups in recent years.

          Many, however, felt he was not scoring those runs quick enough for a
          top-order batter, pointing to his strike rate of 153.51. As if to
          silence his critics, Kohli smashed 92 off 47 balls against Punjab
          Kings on Thursday night to keep Bengaluru alive in the playoff race.
          It was important to keep up my strike rate through the innings, so I
          was just focused on taking the momentum forward for the team, Kohli
          said after the Bengaluru innings.

        <h1>Badminton Article</h1>
        <p>
          Badminton, court or lawn game played with lightweight rackets and a
          shuttlecock. Historically, the shuttlecock (also known as a “bird” or
          “birdie”) was a small cork hemisphere with 16 goose feathers attached
          and weighing about 0.17 ounce (5 grams). These types of shuttles may
          still be used in modern play, but shuttles made from synthetic
          materials are also allowed by the Badminton World Federation. The game
          is named for Badminton, the country estate of the dukes of Beaufort in
          Gloucestershire, England, where it was first played about 1873. The
          roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India,
          and it is closely related to the old children’s game battledore and
          shuttlecock. Badminton is derived directly from poona, which was
          played by British army officers stationed in India in the 1860s. The
          first unofficial all-England badminton championships for men were held
          in 1899, and the first badminton tournament for women was arranged the
          next year.
